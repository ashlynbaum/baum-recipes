These are a thin and crispy chocolate cookie with a hint of mint. They can be made gluten-free by using buckwheat flour. These delicious cookies are naturally sweetened with honey instead of using processed sugar.

Mix the dough. The dough will be soft and sticky before refrigerating. Then roll the dough into one and a half inch thick cylinder shaped logs using plastic wrap. Cool the dough in the refrigerator then slice into thin and even wafers and bake.

Once chocolate covered wafers are cooled, store them in an airtight container. Keep them in the freezer because frozen thin mints are the best!
