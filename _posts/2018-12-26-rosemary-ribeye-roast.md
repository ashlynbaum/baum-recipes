    1. Preheat oven to 450ºF. Place roast, fat side up, on a rack in a shallow
    roasting pan.
    2. Combine garlic, salt, thyme, rosemary and olive oil to make an herb
    paste. Coat roast evenly with paste and place in a pan. (ideally, fitted
    with a rack.)
    3. Place pan in oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 325ºF and continue
    roasting for approximately 2 hours for medium (when thermometer
    registers 130-135°F), or adjust for desired doneness, checking
    temperature with a thermometer.
    4. Transfer roast to cutting board; loosely tent with foil and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. Slice across the grain.
